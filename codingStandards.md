Improve the code quality of project and ensure it aligns with industry standards. Here are a few specific areas we should focus on:

1. **Code Readability and Maintainability**:
   - Ensure all variables, functions, and components have meaningful names.
   - Break down large functions and components into smaller, reusable pieces.
   - Add comments and documentation where necessary to explain complex logic.

2. **Type Safety and Consistency**:
   - Migrate our codebase to TypeScript for better type safety and tooling support.
   - Define and use clear types for props, state, and other data structures.

3. **State Management and Optimization**:
   - Use React Context or state management libraries like Redux for managing global state.
   - Optimize state updates and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

4. **Styling and Accessibility**:
   - Adopt a CSS-in-JS library like styled-components for better styling encapsulation.
   - Ensure all components are accessible, using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.

5. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for all components and business logic using Jest and React Testing Library.
   - Aim for high test coverage and include integration tests where applicable.
